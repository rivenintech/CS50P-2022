## [Problem Set 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/1/)

### [Deep Thought](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/1/deep/)

In `deep.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting `Yes` if the user inputs `42` or (case-insensitively) `forty-two` or `forty two`. Otherwise output `No`.

----

### [Home Federal Savings Bank](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/1/bank/)

In a file called `bank.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with “hello”, output `$0`. If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output `$20`. Otherwise, output `$100`. Ignore any leading whitespace in the user’s greeting, and treat the user’s greeting case-insensitively.

----

### [File Extensions](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/1/extensions/)

In a file called `extensions.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a file and then outputs that file’s media type if the file’s name ends, case-insensitively, in any of these suffixes:

- `.gif`
- `.jpg`
- `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.pdf`
- `.txt`
- `.zip`

If the file’s name ends with some other suffix or has no suffix at all, output `application/octet-stream` instead, which is a common default.

----

### [Math Interpreter](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/1/interpreter/)

In a file called `interpreter.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted as `x y z`, with one space between `x` and `y` and one space between `y` and `z`, wherein:

- `x` is an integer
- `y` is `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`
- `z` is an integer

For instance, if the user inputs `1 + 1`, your program should output `2.0`. Assume that, if `y` is `/`, then `z` will not be `0`.

Note that, just as `python` itself is an interpreter for Python, so will your `interpreter.py` be an interpreter for math!

----

### [Meal Time](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/1/meal/)

In `meal.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a time and outputs whether it’s `breakfast time`, `lunch time`, or `dinner time`. If it’s not time for a meal, don’t output anything at all. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted in 24-hour time as `#:##` or `##:##`. And assume that each meal’s time range is inclusive. For instance, whether it’s 7:00, 7:01, 7:59, or 8:00, or anytime in between, it’s time for breakfast.

Structure your program per the below, wherein `convert` is a function (that can be called by `main`) that converts `time`, a `str` in 24-hour format, to the corresponding number of hours as a `float`. For instance, given a `time` like `"7:30"` (i.e., 7 hours and 30 minutes), `convert` should return `7.5` (i.e., 7.5 hours).
